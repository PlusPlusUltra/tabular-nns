What's New
==========================

Here are the recent updates to **TALENT**:
- [2025-06]ðŸŒŸ Add `TabAutoPNPNet <https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/6/1165>`_ (Electronics 2025)

- [2025-06]ðŸŒŸ Add `TabICL <https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05564>`_ (ICML 2025). The current code is based on TabICL v0.1.2.

- [2025-05]ðŸŒŸ Check out our three papers `MMTU <https://github.com/LAMDA-Tabular/MMTU>`_, `Tabular-Temporal-Shift <https://github.com/LAMDA-Tabular/Tabular-Temporal-Shift>`_, and `BETA <https://github.com/LAMDA-Tabular/BETA>`_ accepted at ICML 2025!

- [2025-04]ðŸŒŸ Check out our new survey `Representation Learning for Tabular Data: A Comprehensive Survey <https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16109>`_ (`Repo <https://github.com/LAMDA-Tabular/Tabular-Survey>`_). We organize existing methods into three main categories according to their generalization capabilities: specialized, transferable, and general models, which provides a comprehensive taxonomy for deep tabular representation methods.ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

- [2025-02]ðŸŒŸ Add `T2Gformer <https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16887>`_ (AAAI 2023).

- [2025-02]ðŸŒŸ Add `TabPFN v2 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08328-6>`_ (Nature).

- [2025-02]ðŸŒŸ Thanks to `Hengzhe Zhang <https://hengzhe-zhang.github.io/>`_ for providing a `Scikit-Learn compatible wrapper <https://github.com/hengzhe-zhang/scikit-TALENT>`_ for TALENT!

- [2025-01]ðŸŒŸ Check out our new baseline `ModernNCA <https://openreview.net/pdf?id=JytL2MrlLT>`_ (**ICLR 2025**), inspired by traditional **Neighbor Component Analysis**, which outperforms both tree-based and other deep tabular models, while also reducing training time and model size!ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

- [2025-01]ðŸŒŸ Check out our `latest version of the benchmark paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00956>`_ for updated and expanded results and analysis!

- [2025-01]ðŸŒŸWe have curated and released `new benchmark datasets <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j1zt3zQIo8dO6vkO-K-WE6pSrl71bf0z?usp=drive_link>`_, along with updated `results <https://6sy666.github.io/TALENT-Results/>`_ of the dataset across a broader range of methods. This update focuses on enhancing dataset quality, including removing duplicates, and correcting tasks where bin-class was mistakenly treated as regression. We have also separated the larger datasets and formed the basic benchmark (300 datasets, including 120 bin-class, 80 multi-class, and 100 regression), and the large benchmark (22 datasets).
